                    Ah, the tavern, the centerpiece of all standard fantasy stories. You stride through the door to the sound of drinking and merriment, songs about war and pride and last year&#x27;s depressing harvest, leading to famine and chronic starvation--
                    
                    Or, at least, that&#x27;s what you would have *liked* to say- to your surprise, the building was empty. Barren, even. Comically large casks of ale and wine sat empty, broken and battered by some unknown force that had torn through the room relentlessly, leaving not even a drop of intoxicating succour behind. 
                    
                    Well, this was depressing.
