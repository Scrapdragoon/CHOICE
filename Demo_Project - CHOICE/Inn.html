                    You stumble through the door, met only with a few cursory glances from a tired-looking couple fidgeting by a counter, and a woman sitting behind it. The couple catches sight of your hand and flinch in unison, while the woman- presumably, the owner- doesn&#x27;t seem surprised in the slightest. 
                    
                    &quot;I&#x27;ll be with you in a minute, love,&quot; she drones, her tone indicating she didn&#x27;t think nearly as high of you as her words indicated. &quot;Just don&#x27;t drip all over my floor.&quot; She turns back towards the couple, and the three of them return to whatever they were doing before- the couple searching their pockets and bags, and the woman staring blankly into space. 
                    
                    You...

                                Step into a large room containing a large, round table and myriad of chairs to the right of the entrance. Might as well find somewhere to sit while you wait.
