                    The cellar fared no better. Countless bottles and mugs lay smashed upon the ground, covered in layers of dust and dirt; the sorry sight making your eyes sting with the prick of tears. (That, or maybe it was due to the sneeze you were holding back; the particles floating in the air were irritating your delicate inner nose hairs quite eagerly.)
                    
                    Not even the smell of yeast remained. Whatever happened here, you&#x27;re far too late to do anything about it.
