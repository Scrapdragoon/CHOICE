                    You arrive just inside the castle&#x27;s first set of walls, finding yourself in a much more impressive town square. An exquisite fountain jets water into the air, a beautiful crocodile hewn from stone sitting prettily in the center, a twisted imitation of a grin plastered on its extremely detailed face.
