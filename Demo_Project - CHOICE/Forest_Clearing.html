                    You wake up in a clearing, with no memory as to who you are, how you got here, or how exactly you ended up with a dagger impaled though your right hand. It appears to have been bleeding for some time, but to you, it&#x27;s almost as if it wasn&#x27;t there- you can&#x27;t feel it in the slightest. You decide, intelligently, not to touch it. 
                    
                    You (carefully) push yourself to your feet, (gingerly) brush off your backside, and take a look at your surroundings. A dirt road leads off into the distance to your right, and the maw of an ominous-looking cave sits directly behind you.
                    
                    All you want is to get this dagger out of your hand before the pain assumedly returns.
                    
                    What do you do?
