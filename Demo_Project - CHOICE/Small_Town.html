                    You arrive in a small town. A cursory glance around you reveals several buildings- an inn, a tavern, and a few humble homes. 
                    
                    Then, you notice the giant castle looming to the north. Was that always there? Its magnificant drawbridge lies flat across a deep, murky moat. 
                    
                    Where to?

                                There might be a doctor at the inn.
