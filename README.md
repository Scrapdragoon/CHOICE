CHOICE is a tool used to create text-based adventure games, which can then be exported and played in any web browser. Version 1.8 includes the ability to add images and choose from two CSS "themes" for export. I will likely add more refinements and features slowly over time.


To use the application, download the CHOICE v1.8.zip file, extract it, and run CHOICE v1.8.exe to use the application.
Running the CHOICE application requires Oracle's Java Runtime Environment, which you can download [here.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows) Please keep the CHOICE v1.8.exe file within the same folder as the master_resources directory!

To play the game I created using this tool, please download the "Demo_Project - CHOICE" folder and open the Forest_Clearing.html file.
The aforementioned ZIP also contains the CHOICE file for the Demo Project game, so please take a look at that if you're interested!

You'll find the source code for this application in the Capstone Project GUI folder, so check that out if you'd like to see its inner workings.

I am currently trying to get the technical documentation hosted here on this site.
