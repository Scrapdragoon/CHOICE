CHOICE is a tool used to create text-based adventure games, which can then be exported and played in any web browser. Version 1.8 includes the ability to add images and choose from two CSS "themes" for export. I will likely add more refinements and features slowly over time.


To use the application, download the CHOICE v1.8.zip file, extract it, and run CHOICE v1.8.jar.
Running the CHOICE application requires Oracle's Java Runtime Environment, which you can download [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows). Please keep the CHOICE v1.8.exe file within the same folder as the master_resources directory!

### You can play a demo game I made using this tool [here](https://scrapdragoon.github.io/game/Forest_Clearing.html)!

View the Javadoc for this project [here](https://scrapdragoon.github.io/CHOICE/docs/).


Thanks for stopping by!
