To use the application, download the CHOICE v1.8.zip file, extract it, and run CHOICE v1.8.exe to use the application.
Running the CHOICE application requires Oracle's Java Runtime Environment, which you can download [here.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows) Please remember to keep the CHOICE v1.8.exe file within the same folder as the master_resources directory!

To play the game I created using this tool, please download the "Demo_Project - CHOICE" folder and open the Forest_Clearing.html file.
The aforementioned ZIP also contains the CHOICE file for the Demo Project game, so please take a look at that if you're interested!

You'll find the source code for this application in the Capstone Project GUI folder, so check that out if you'd like to see its inner workings.

The Technical Documentation directory contains the folder that holds the Javadoc for this project. Please download the 'apidocs' folder and open the file named "index.html" to view.
