Welcome to the repository for the Condensed Hypertext Organization Interface for the Creation of Experiences! 

To use the application, download the CHOICE v1.8.zip file, extract it, and run CHOICE v1.8.exe to use the application.
Running the CHOICE application requires Oracle's Java Runtime Environment, which you can download [here.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk18-windows)
The ZIP also contains a game of my own making, so please take a look at that if you're interested! Start from the Forest_Clearing.html file.

You'll find the source code in the Capstone Project GUI folder, so check that out if you'd like to see its inner workings.

The Technical Documentation directory contains the folder that holds the Javadoc for this project. Please download the 'site' folder and open the file named "index.html" to view.
